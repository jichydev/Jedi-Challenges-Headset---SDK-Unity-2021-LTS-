# LenovoMirageAR-Unity2021SDK

Lenovo Mirage AR Headset SDK for Unity 2021 LTS (2021.3.11f1)

## Setup

1. Add the "Assets" folder to empty Unity project.
2. Add all 5 scenes from "VisionSDK/Demos/BasicExample/Scenes" to Build (BasicExampleSceneOne should be first)
3. Build the app (I've tested only on Android 12 Xiaomi Note 10 Pro)

## Demo application

First scene (BasicExampleSceneOne) is for initial setup:
- pair the controller (LightSaber) and calibrate it (rotating in 8 figure)
- start simple AR scene (BasicExampleSceneTwo)
- device settings - tweak parameters for your phone display - add them to VisionSDK/Resources/Profiles
- headset settings - I will have to figure that out :)

## Build your scene from scratch
